If you create a program that is dynamically linked against SDL, you risk dependency hell on you clients' machines. If you statically link against SDL, and use of most of SDL's features, then you need to link against many additional libraries.  This project gathers all these static libraries together.  Initially, it will target Win32, Mac OSX, iPhoneOS and Linux32, with support for Win64 and Linux64 if I can find a willing helper.
